# Unicorn-SalesProfitOptimization

This project focuses on analyzing sales, profit, and discount data for Unicorn Company. Using spreadsheets and SQL, the data was processed and analyzed to derive key insights. The final Tableau dashboard provides a visual representation of how discounts impact profitability, regional performance, and trends across product categories. The aim is to help optimize sales strategies and improve profit margins through data-driven decision-making.
